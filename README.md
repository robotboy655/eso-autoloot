# Smarter Autoloot Revamped

An improved and reworked version of `Smarter AutoLoot (S.A.L.)` addon by `Agathorn` for Elder Scroll Online.

Original addon link: https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1127-SmarterAutoLootS.A.L..html

I developed/modified this while playing Elder Scrolls Online back in 2023, since other available options were sub par for my liking.

I never really finished it, but just gonna put it here so this work is not lost. If you find this, you can do whatever you want with it.

I do not have a change log vs the original, but there are many improvements, inclding stuff like more item categories, detecting ESO+ and autolooting all ingredients, etc. 

Addons normally go to `Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/AddOns/` folder. Since I haven't played since 2023, I do not know if it still works due to any potential API changes.

Known issues:
* Some special currency items are not automatically picked up. I was never able to work around this, it seemed like an API limitation from the game.
* If I remember correctly, sometimes the empty loot window would not auto close.
* `Destroy unlooted items` option may not be functional. I never trusted addons destroying items, so I never worked on it either.
